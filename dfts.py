    """
    Calculate the discrete Fourier transform of y.

    Parameters
    ----------

    y : float
        Discretely sampled function to transform; must be real
        numbers.

    Returns
    -------

    complex
        Fourier transform of input, length ``N//2 + 1`` where ``N``
        is the length of ``y``.
